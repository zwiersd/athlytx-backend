Hi Marc,

Thank you for the feedback regarding the Garmin branding attribution.

You're absolutely correct - we've now updated our Garmin data displays to comply with page 4 of the Garmin Health API Brand Guidelines.

**Changes Implemented:**

1. **Prominent "Powered by Garmin" Header** - Large Garmin logo (60px) at the top of all Garmin health data displays

2. **Individual Data Attribution** - Garmin logo placed directly beneath or adjacent to every health metric display:
   - All hero stat cards (Activities, Distance, Heart Rate, Training Time, Body Battery, Stress, HRV, Respiration)
   - All data visualization charts (Heart Rate Zones, Body Battery Trend, Stress Distribution, HRV & Respiration)
   - Recent Activities list

3. **Compliance with Guidelines** - All Garmin device-sourced data now includes visible Garmin.svg logo attribution as required

Per the guidelines: *"Position the Garmin attribution directly beneath or adjacent to the primary title or heading of the data view. The listing must be placed above the fold and always be visually associated with the data it supports."*

**Updated Screenshots Attached:**
[You will attach screenshots here]

All attribution uses the official Garmin.svg logo from the GCDP Branding Assets package, with no modifications or alterations. The logo is now clearly visible on every piece of Garmin health data displayed in our application.

**Note:** We're currently receiving activity data via PUSH webhooks. We're monitoring for daily health metrics (dailies, sleep, etc.) and expect to receive those within 24 hours as users' devices sync overnight.

Please let me know if these updates meet the Garmin branding requirements, or if you need any additional changes.

Best regards,
