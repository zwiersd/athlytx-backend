Dear Elena,

Thank you for your response.

I'm unable to enable Activity API on my test app at https://apis.garmin.com/tools/apiConfiguration - the option is not available for me to select.

Could you please enable Activity API on my test app so I can proceed with testing?

**Test App:** Athlytx (Evaluation)
**Test Client ID:** ee6809d5-abc0-4a33-b38a-d433e5045987

**Production App:** Athlytx Fitness
**Production Client ID:** 4af31e5c-d758-442d-a007-809ea45f444a

Once enabled, I'll complete testing and provide screenshots as requested.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Athlytx
