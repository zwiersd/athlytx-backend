Read the project context file at `.claude/CONTEXT.md` first, then read ALL API documentation files from `/Users/darrenzwiers/Documents/GitHub/athlytx-backend/API Documentation/` to understand the provider APIs before working on any tasks.

Pay special attention to:
- Garmin Health API requirements (PUSH only, no PULL)
- Current endpoint configuration
- Known issues and fixes already implemented
- User preferences for communication style

After reading the context, summarize what you learned and confirm you're ready to help.
